    // Method Description:
    /// Solves the equation a x = b by computing a vector x
    /// that minimizes the Euclidean 2-norm || b - a x ||^2.
    /// The equation may be under-, well-, or over- determined
    /// (i.e., the number of linearly independent rows of a can
    /// be less than, equal to, or greater than its number of
    /// linearly independent columns). If a is square and of
    /// full rank, then x (but for round-off error) is the
    /// "exact" solution of the equation.
