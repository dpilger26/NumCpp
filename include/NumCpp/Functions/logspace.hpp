    // Method Description:
    /// Return numbers spaced evenly on a log scale.
    ///
    /// This is similar to logspace, but with endpoints specified directly.
    /// Each output sample is a constant multiple of the previous.
    ///
    /// NumPy Reference: https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.logspace.html
    ///
    /// @param start: the starting value of a sequence
    /// @param stop: The final value of the sequence, unless endpoint is False.
    /// In that case, num + 1 values are spaced over the interval
    /// in log-space, of which all but the last (a sequence of length num) are returned.
    /// @param num: Number of samples to generate. Default 50.
    /// @param endPoint: If true, stop is the last sample. Otherwise,it is not included. Default is true.
    /// @param base: The base of the log space. The step size between the elements in ln(samples) / ln(base)
    /// @return NdArray
    ///
