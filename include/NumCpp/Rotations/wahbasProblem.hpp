/// Description
/// In applied mathematics, Wahba's problem, first posed by Grace Wahba in 1965, seeks to
/// find a rotation matrix (special orthogonal matrix) between two coordinate systems from
/// a set of (weighted) vector observations. Solutions to Wahba's problem are often used in
/// satellite attitude determination utilising sensors such as magnetometers and multi-antenna
/// GPS receivers
